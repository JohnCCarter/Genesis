## Current Structure Comparison

### Legacy (Genesis-frontend branch)
```
frontend/
├── risk_panel.html     # Monolithic risk panel
├── ws_test.html        # Monolithic WebSocket test
└── ...
```

### Modern (main/copilot branches)
```
frontend/
├── dashboard/          # React-based dashboard
├── risk-panel/         # Modular risk panel (HTML, CSS, JS)
├── ws-test/           # Modular WebSocket test (HTML, CSS, JS)
├── shared/            # Shared utilities
└── ...
```

## Notes
- The `ws_test.html` file was originally ignored by `.gitignore` but was force-added to preserve the legacy structure
- The legacy files contain embedded styles and scripts, representing the original monolithic approach
- These files serve as a backup/reference for the original frontend implementation
- The current modern structure in other branches maintains the same functionality with better modularity

## Usage
To access the legacy frontend:
1. Switch to Genesis-frontend branch: `git checkout Genesis-frontend`
2. Open files directly in browser or serve via web server
3. Files contain all necessary dependencies embedded or via CDN

## Restoration Process
1. Extracted files from backup zip archive
2. Created new Genesis-frontend branch
3. Restored legacy HTML files to frontend directory
4. Committed with descriptive message
5. Files now preserved for future reference or rollback if needed
